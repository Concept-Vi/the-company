# skills/ — module constitution

**Is:** the **file-discovered SKILL registry** (Concurrent Cognition C 3b). A **skill** is a declared,
reusable unit of **instructions** — the instructions text a role reads as its INPUT. Skills are a
registry like anything else (Tim, 2026-06-08: "skills/contexts are registries like anything else —
registry-is-truth"): a `skills/` dir, one self-registering `skills/<id>.py` per skill — **exactly
mirroring how roles + node-types self-register** (`roles/` + `runtime/roles.py`; `nodes/` +
`runtime/registry.py`). Adding a skill = adding a file; it self-registers, is queryable, and is
**addressable as `skill://<id>`**; a removed file un-registers on `rediscover`.

**Guarantees:** a skill is **one self-contained declaration** — a module-level `SKILL` dict over the
minimal registry-row schema `{id · content · label · description}`. `id` (MUST equal the file stem)
and `content` (the resolvable value — the instructions a role reads) are required; `label`/`description`
are optional operator-facing fields (like roles have). On drop-in it self-registers
(`SkillRegistry.discover` reads `skills/*.py`) and `skill://<id>` resolves to its `content` — **with no
change to the resolver, the cognition driver, or the UI.**

**The skills (the live set — the drift home; `tests/skills_contexts_acceptance.py` asserts each is reflected here):**
- **`summarize`** — the seed skill: reusable instructions to faithfully condense supplied content
  (keep load-bearing detail + relationships, add nothing, no preamble). The demonstrative first member
  (like `roles/judge.py` was the seed role) — real + usable, so `skill://summarize` resolves to actual
  instructions a role can take as its primary input.
- **`extract_decisions`** — the demonstrative **DIRECT-CREATE skill** (#56 write-half · #58): authored
  LIVE by the agent via `create_skill` (no operator approval — the skill-writing-skill, direct), it is
  reusable instructions to list every DECISION a document records (one per line, `<decision> -
  <rationale>`). `skill://extract_decisions` resolves to those instructions; readable via
  `list_skills_contexts`. Proof the skill write-half is the agent's: written + git-committed `[self-apply]`
  + live with NO surfaced item.

**The COMPOSITION skills (AK3 — Cognition Engine · per-workflow recipes):** a single tool-description
describes ONE tool; it cannot encode multi-step composition (the ORDER, the output→input wiring, when to
use which tier). Each of these is the RECIPE for one MULTI-STEP cognition workflow, naming the REAL
now-built tools (`capture`·`run_items`·`run_reduce`·`find_relations`·`find_runs`·`inspect_address`·
`findings_for`·`create_projection`·`read_corpus_record`·`list_corpus`·`find_corpus`·`run_role`·
`reduce_rule_names`·`cognition_info` — all in `mcp_face/server.py`). They are agent/operator-facing
composition playbooks (same registry row + format as `summarize`); a role *can* read one as input, but
their primary use is as the recipe a reader composes the tools from. The FLOOR holds — each is
declarative content describing how to compose READ / RUN / declarative-create tools; none instructs
emitting resolve/approve/dispatch or launching `claude -p`.
- **`corpus_pipeline`** — the 3-layer corpus pipeline: `capture` (describe over N units → corpus records)
  → `run_items` (extract) → `run_items` (project) → the engine/bridge capture+embed pass → `run_reduce`
  (cluster THEN synthesize) → `findings_for`. The order + each step's output→next-input wiring. Flags the
  two registry-is-truth gaps honestly: there is NO standalone `embed` MCP tool (LAYER-2 embed is the
  engine pass over embeddable lenses; `run_role(op='embed')` is the one-off vector actuator, distinct),
  and NO write-`mark` tool (`findings_for` is the READ side only).
- **`patterned_visibility`** — the patterned-visibility loop: run → look/compare (`list_corpus`·
  `find_corpus`·`find_relations`·`findings_for`·`read_corpus_record`·`find_runs`) → mark the pattern
  (encode it as a new lens via `create_projection`, since there is no write-`mark` tool) → that reveals
  the next step → repeat. Discovery is a loop, not a pre-scripted list.
- **`inversion_query`** — the inversion-query: `find_relations(item, near_space, far_space)` returns the
  near∩¬far cross-space set difference (same principle, different subject). When + how to use it,
  including the inversion read to find what is MISSING; space ids come from `cognition_info().spaces`,
  and it fails loud without a persisted vector for `item` in both spaces.
- **`map_reduce_composition`** — map-vs-reduce: when to `run_items` (1 role × N units, the MAP) vs
  `run_reduce` (cross-unit JOIN: role|rule|cluster), and how to chain them (the MAP's `addresses` output
  feeds the REDUCE's `addresses` input — the load-bearing seam).

**How it resolves (the address seam — C 3b is its FIRST real extension):** `skill://<id>` is resolved
by `runtime/cognition.py:resolve_address` (the C 3/4 scheme-dispatching seam). It dispatches `skill://`
to `runtime/skills.py:SkillRegistry.read(id)`, which returns the skill's `content`. An UNKNOWN id
RAISES fail-loud (registry-is-truth — never fabricate). A role with `input_addresses=[skill://summarize]`
reads the skill's instructions as its input (via `run_items`/`resolve_address`) — the input-address
intent, fully realised.

**Where new things go:** a new skill = a new file `skills/<id>.py` declaring its `SKILL` dict (its `id`
MUST equal the file name). **Update THIS file** (the drift home) when you add a skill —
`tests/skills_contexts_acceptance.py` fails loud if a discovered skill isn't reflected here (mirrors how
`roles_acceptance` guards roles against `roles/AGENTS.md`).

**Seam:** discovered by `runtime/skills.py:SkillRegistry` (mirrors `runtime/roles.py:RoleRegistry`,
which mirrors `runtime/registry.py:NodeRegistry` — reuse-don't-parallel, the ONE registry pattern);
resolved via `runtime/cognition.py:resolve_address` (the `skill://` dispatch branch); the scheme is
declared additively in `contracts/address.py:SCHEMES`.

**Never:** hardcode a skill in a literal list/dict (this module IS the no-hardcoding rule — the registry
path, never the literal) · fork a second registry pattern (mirror `RoleRegistry`/`NodeRegistry`) ·
resolve an unknown id to anything but a fail-loud RAISE (registry-is-truth, never fabricate) · ship a
skill without reflecting it in this drift home.

## Relates to
- **Discovered by** [[runtime — constitution]] (`runtime/skills.py`, mirroring `runtime/roles.py`).
- **Mirrors** [[roles — constitution]] — the same self-registering, file-discovered, addressable shape.
- **Resolved through** the C 3/4 address seam (`runtime/cognition.py:resolve_address`); the scheme is
  declared in [[contracts — constitution]] (`SCHEMES`).
