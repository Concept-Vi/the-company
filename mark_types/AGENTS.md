# mark_types/ — module constitution

**Is:** the **file-discovered MARK-TYPE registry** (Cognition Engine NEWMOD · M1 · M4 · P1). A **mark**
is the disposition a mark-pass writes over a corpus unit (Group M): the coherence finding store IS the
marks layer (same shape: `target / mark_type / value / confidence / source_pass / evidence / status`).
A **mark-type** is the declared VOCABULARY of `mark_type` — one named KIND of disposition a pass may
write. A mark-pass = a `run_role`/`run_reduce` pass that `append_finding`s with a `mark_type` DRAWN FROM
this registry. Mark-types are a registry **like anything else**: a `mark_types/` dir, one
self-registering `mark_types/<id>.py` per kind — **exactly mirroring roles/skills/projections/node-types**.
Adding a mark-type = adding a FILE; a removed file un-registers on `rediscover`.

**Why file-discovered, not a python dict (PART 4.3):** **add-a-row = a FILE, no code edit.** The
mark-type vocabulary MUST be directory-discovered, file-per-entry + create_*-authorable, NOT
`MARK_TYPES = {...}`.

**Guarantees:** a mark-type is **one self-contained declaration** — a module-level `MARK_TYPE` dict over
the schema `{id · value_shape · direction · desc}`. Required: `id` (MUST equal the file stem) ·
`value_shape` (how the mark's value is read — score/label/bool/span/free; open vocab DATA).
`direction` (`surface`=positive signal | `subtract`=noise to subtract, the inversion — fingerprint-
subtraction; defaults to `surface`) + `desc` optional. A malformed entry FAILS LOUD at discovery; a
non-`MARK_TYPE`/`_`-file is skipped.

**The mark-types (the live set — the drift home; `tests/mark_types_acceptance.py` asserts each is reflected here):**
- **`gold_likelihood`** — score · **surface**. Likelihood a unit is gold (MEANING, not surface artifact);
  the PROFILE is a READ over findings+evidence (never a stored opaque score — the operator sees-why, can overrule).
- **`ai_fingerprint`** — label · **subtract**. A matched AI-tic (generic+recurring) to subtract — denoising
  is surfacing, OPPOSITE direction. The seed that EXERCISES the surface-vs-subtract split.
- **`contradiction`** — span · **surface**. This unit contradicts another (a tension surfaced for review;
  render-not-judge — the operator decides).
- **`built_twice`** — claim · **surface**. The same logic/vocabulary built in 2+ places — a unification
  target surfaced for review (COMPOSITION ② drift-radar's `judge_drift` confirm). Value `{with, shared, source}`.
- **`overlap`** — claim · **surface**. Significant shared responsibility between near units — a softer
  unification candidate than `built_twice` (② drift-radar). Value `{with, shared, source}`.
- **`strain`** — score · **surface**. Structure↔meaning DIVERGENCE (SEED §111): |where a unit is FILED
  (repo-tree distance from the centre) - where it MEANS to be (semantic distance)|. 0 = coherent (filed
  where it means); high = strain/resistance. The instrument computes it live per-point in semantic mode
  (the radial tension segment r_struct↔r); this row lets it be MARKED + surfaced as a finding. Render,
  NEVER auto-correct — operator-overridable (Group 7). Value the 0..1 magnitude.

*The INTERACTION mark-types (the directions-at-address vocabulary — wildcard's taxonomies.json — written by the route-back `gallery:direction` -> `runtime.territory.territory_write` -> `suite.mark`; additive beside the analysis types above, registry-is-truth):*
- **`comment`** — free · **surface**. An operator comment/direction at an addressed element; the sub-type rides in `annotation_type` (note/direction/correction/question/praise/discuss), `value` = the free text.
- **`reaction`** — label · **surface**. An operator reaction-stamp at an addressed element; `value` = the reaction (good/wrong/explain/remember_this/do_this).
- **`favour`** — score · **surface**. An operator favour score at an addressed element; `value` = a number.
- **`decision_take`** — free · **surface**. The operator's CHOICE on an addressed decision (decision-surface, 2026-06-18) — `value` = the chosen option's LABEL (= the decided_value), `target` = the CANONICAL decision address (`contracts.address.decision_address` → `decision://global/<id>`, frame explicit), optional `by` = who decided. The `decision://` resolver (`runtime/decision_registry.compose_state`) composes the decided state from the LATEST `decision_take` mark on that address (none ⇒ pending). Registered id is `decision_take` (underscore = file stem) — composition's "decision-take" (hyphen) is informal, exactly as `ai_fingerprint` is the informally-named "ai-fingerprint".
- **`decision_retract`** — free · **surface**. The operator's UN-DECIDE (decision-surface twin, 2026-06-20) — returns a `decision://<frame>/<id>` from `decided` back to `pending` (the operator-undo / 'Change' primitive, append-only, audit-preserving). `value` empty/optional (optional human `note`); `target` = the canonical decision address. `compose_state` folds it: a `decision_retract` appended AFTER a take (newer ts) wins → pending; a later take re-decides. (Was missing from this live-set — drift fixed 2026-06-22.)
- **`decision_update`** — free · **surface**. L5 (2026-06-22, Tim greenlit). The RHM's PROPOSED refinement of a decision card — `value` = `{field, value}` (`field` ∈ the CONTENT whitelist meaning/options/legibility/dimensions/device; NEVER subtype/id/address/scope), `by`=`rhm`, `target` = the canonical decision address. INERT until accepted; `compose_definition` folds the ACCEPTED updates onto the row (the row never mutates). Model A: the AI proposes, the operator applies.
- **`decision_update_accept`** — free · **surface**. L5's operator twin — APPLIES an RHM `decision_update`; `value` = the accepted update's `ts`. A LIGHT operator-confirm (the #1b token-enforcement held OFF + Tim's fully-open lean → not a security-gate; the actor+mark-type is the discriminator). `compose_definition` composes only updates with a matching accept (no matching `decision_update_reject`). Hole-1: an accepted options-touching update on a DECIDED card re-opens it.

**The floor + render-not-judge:** a mark-type is DECLARED DATA — a vocabulary, not an action. Reading is
a READ (`subtractive`/`as_records`, never `resolve`). A mark DESCRIBES a disposition; judgement of
truth/quality is a later reduce pass, and the operator can overrule. A mark-pass appends a finding
(telemetry/index), never resolves — the floor holds.

**Where new things go:** a new disposition kind = a new file `mark_types/<id>.py` declaring its
`MARK_TYPE` dict. **Update THIS file** when you add one — `tests/mark_types_acceptance.py` fails loud
if a discovered mark-type isn't reflected here.

**To extend:** drop a `mark_types/<id>.py` → it self-registers → a mark-pass may stamp it (drawn from
`as_records()` — registry-is-truth). To author one from the agent face: a future `create_mark_type`
(declarative-direct, like `create_projection`) reuses THIS registry's `_build_mark_type` gate; long-term
home `runtime/authoring.py` + `Suite.create_mark_type` — **flagged as a seam (the WIRING is a SEPARATE
coordinated pass, NOT built in this lane)**.

**Seam:** discovered by `runtime/mark_types.py:MarkTypeRegistry` (mirrors `ProjectionRegistry`/
`RoleRegistry`/`NodeRegistry` — the ONE registry mechanism). Consumers: `subtractive()` (the inversion
set) · `as_records()` (cognition_info + the mark-pass vocabulary). All pure READS — the floor.

**Never:** hardcode a mark-type in a literal · fork a second registry pattern · let a mark-type JUDGE
or a mark-pass RESOLVE (render-not-judge; the floor) · ship one without reflecting it here.
